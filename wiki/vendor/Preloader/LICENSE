Hello,

Most of the extension code I wrote should be MIT-licensed, but this hasn't
a declaration, of course. Clearly, I have no particular desire to restrict
use of the code by any means.

Would it being MIT licensed be sufficient for your purposes? If so, then
consider this a retrospective declaration of such; otherwise, let me know
what you need.

Kind regards,

Rob Church

Heya Rob - I know you don't work on this anymore at all, but need to
ask -- is this particular piece of code under some sort of GPL/MIT/MPL
license?

I just want to commit some of my personal changes to my own Github but
wanted to be sure I wasn't violating your rights. Thanks!
