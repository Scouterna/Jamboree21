/**
 * '#formredlink' is called in a very similar way to 'formlink' - the only
 * difference is that it lacks the 'link text', 'link type' and 'tooltip'
 * parameters. Its behavior is quite similar to that of 'formlink' as well;
 * the only difference is that, when the 'target' is an existing page, it
 * creates a link directly to that page, instead of to a form to edit the
 * page.
